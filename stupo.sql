If you are weak in Technical aspects you should impress him here itself. Answer him the way that he should get impressed. Use all your extra curricular activities  and  technical ones that you have done till fourth year. Mostly he will ask you the questions regarding internship /projects. Go thoroughly with the stuff that you have done in internship/project. Interviewer deliberately says \"You don\'t know anything\" if you don\'t answer. Most of the times, people get nervous and don\'t answer further questions perfectly. Interviewer also reads your psychological state of mind. Regarding technical questions you should be prepared with all the basics and any one of your favorite subject a bit deeper. To get deeper in your favorite subject i would suggest you to use \"QUORA\".\r\nPersonal Experience:\r\nMy first question was about my internship and I didn\'t answer it perfectly. He said \"How people make up an answer even without knowing it\". I was slightly nervous then. He asked me the basic technical questions (All subjects) and I answered him the most. He asked me what was my Favorite Subject. Mine was \"IC Engines\" and I answered every single question with an excitement. He didn\'t allow me to use pencil to answer(briefly) one of his questions. At the end, he asked me regarding doubts. I asked him why he didn\'t allow me to use pencil. He said he wanted to test my Communication skills. He said that i deserve a better company than his. I answered him  \" hire me if you wish\".

From more than 100 students, if I am not faltering in numbers, about 20 students were shortlisted for the interviews.',3,17),(56,40,'This was a sort of explanatory session, in which you explain the methods or the approaches you might have had thought while solving the previously mentioned written test. They asked for some improvements in the already written code. For example, in one of the questions where the time complexity was O(n^3), they stressed for about 10 minutes to write the same code with a  better time complexity.\r\nThey also focussed on trees a lot. They mentioned a BST and asked to print its envelope. Each time I answered, they modified the question and asked me to redo the same. One thing which helped me was the genial nature of the interviewers. They (there were 2 in my panel) were very soft in speech and always gave me empressement whenever I moved ahead in the task assigned; =this boosted confidence and I think I answered what they had anticipated. So don\'t feel panic when you are stuck at some point. Take your own sweet time and the interviewers always appreciate this.',1,10),(57,75,'This was a bit challenging round for me. The interviewer( who was the senior most among the people came to the campus) was very friendly and immediately made me feel at home when he started his first question on sorting. He asked about quick sort and a short comparative analysis of the time and space complexities of major sorting algorithms. Though these type of questions were expected, I answered them quite well, not losing a bit of my composure. Then, he went on to asking questions on strings,the array of pointers and some simple programs. Everything was going on quite well by this time. Then he got some phone call and he asked one of his colleagues to resume the interview. This fellow inchoated his questions from graphs and trees. I think some of the questions were of the type what we find in geeks for geeks. He asked an algorithm based on graphs. I humbly told him that I was not very conversant with graph theory and he shifted again to BST. He asked about traversal of trees which can give numbers in a particular order, viz., ascending and descending. Now the old interviewer returned and gave me a pattern to print. He gave me 15 minutes to solve and told firmly that if you solve this, you are in; otherwise we are happy to interview you. They both chuckled and went away. After 20 minutes, they returned, only to find out that I had solved that.',3,10),(58,15,'They asked me about my family and my hobbies. When I told reading, he asked what was the last book I had finished. \r\nThey asked FactSet in general. CEO, Headquarter and products. I told them, not very satisfactorily, I believe.\r\nFuture plans?\r\nPreviously, how many interviews I faced?\r\nAt last when I was leaving the cabin, pretty tensed (since I was rejected 6 times previously in the interviews in the last 5 days), they sensing my nervousness, told me- \"Don\'t worry, you will get hired.\" These were the best words I heard that complete afternoon.',1,11),(59,20,'The technical round consisted of applying your areas of expertise basically in data structure design.

It was followed by discussion on the major project in the resume. Never mention DSPD assignments in your CV. Mine consisted of Big Data analytics project I worked on during IIT-B intern.

So speed and accuracy were imperative for clearing this section.',3,16),(63,30,'First round of filtering was done on basis of aptitude test.

He was very jovial.He asked me to relax when I went I entered the interview room.He asked me around 6-7 technical questions which were very basic .Some of them are mentioned below:-\r\n\r\n1.What is the difference between a microcontroller and a microprocessor?\r\n2.Draw all the parts of microprocessor 8085(registers,buffers...)\r\n3.Draw the circuit diagram of rectifiers I have studied(he gave a sheet  to draw).\r\n4.Draw the symbol of NPN transistor\r\n5.What is SCR?\r\nThese are the questions  I can remember .There were 2 more questions which I cannot recollect but were rather simple.\r\nThe interviewer seemed to be in a good mood that day .He kept sayinf \'good\' as a token of appreciation whenenver I gave the right answer.In the end ,the HR interviewer came back and asked me if I had any questions to ask about the company.\r\n',1,10),(65,60,'1.

Introduce yourself and your stand on the topic of the discussion very clearly and in very crisp manner\r\n2. Maintain good eye contact with the team you are discussing with. At intervals also give a slight smille to your observer. Nod to the points of the ones supporting your stand.\r\n3. It may happen that yours mind stops thinking and goes blank due to the pressure, in such a case or even when you dont know any facts or havent heatd about the TOPIC ever, always try to LISTEN TO OTHER\'S POINTS very attentively. Then built up your points by reframing the already said point in such a way that the guy speaking originally will hi self think if it really was his point. Either agree or disagree but always reframe other\'s points in very good way.\r\n4. Don\'t cut anyone in middle of his point. This upsets the company guy more than any thing else.\r\n5.

Questions were asked from Solid Mechanics, Fluid Mechanics, Machine Design, Thermodynamics, Heat Transfer, Manufacturing Process and Theory of Machine.

So read that section first and then come back here. \r\nNow I will share about the interview experience. The interview panel had two people and as I entered the room they greeted by a handshake with a big smile on their face and asked me to sit and also asked whether I need tea or not? I mentioned this because I have never seen any panel to be this humble. So the environment becomes quite comfortable. They were reading my form and add-on sheet before I entered and then the first question they asked me was, \"Tell me something about yourself\", then they asked for my family and academic background. Prepare the answer for Tell me about yourself, this is mostly the first question you are likely to face, so be confident and fluent while answering and make sure your content is strong enough to impress the interviewers. Remember the old saying, \"The first impression is the last impression\". After that, they asked me about my favorite subjects. I mentioned Thermodynamics and Strength of Material. Then they asked what I like the most about Thermodynamics, I replied, \"I like the way how the engine works.\" So they passed me a pencil and paper and asked to explain different Air-Standard Cycles. I drew the PV Diagrams and explained each step with its physical meaning. Then they asked me to draw the TS Diagrams and how can you justify that the expansion i.e the power stroke is an adiabatic process. They also asked me about the Multi-Port Fuel Injection System and how that makes any difference in the Otto Cycle. I said I don\'t know about it and then sooner they shifted to the next subject. They asked me about the theories of failures. I told about all six theories and they asked me about their applications. They gave me Cantilever Beam with a point load on its end and asked me to draw its SFD and BMD Diagram, and how can I show triaxial stresses on that cantilever beam. Then they asked me how will I design a square cross-sectional cantilever beam, so I explained from the beginning by considering the Bending Moment Equation, told the physical meaning of all terms and then the major focus was given to how I will calculate the maximum allowable bending stress, They asked me whether it is the property of material or the load applied. So I said maximum allowable bending stress is calculated by knowing two things: 1. Yield(for Ductile) or Ultimate Stress(for brittle) and 2. The factor of Safety(depends on the application- Aerospace- 1.5-2 and Structures/Civil Engineering- 2-10). By knowing the application and material of the beam, one can calculate the bending stress and then find the area of cross-section. \r\nThis was the end. They asked me whether I have any questions for them, I asked how a candidate is evaluated in its first year of Job. The shared their complete module and finally asked do I have any location problem to which I replied no. Then with a firm handshake, the interview was over.
